You can use this phrase when speaking with friends, co-workers, or family</li>\n<li>¿Qué tal? – casual way to ask how someone is doing, similar to the phrase “What’s up?” in English.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Pardons</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Con permiso – “excuse me”</li>\n<li>Disculpe – politely way to get someone,s attention.</li>\n<li>Perdón – apologizing for something you’ve done—bumping into someone, for example.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Asking for directions</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>¿Dónde está…? – “Where is…?” Then it’s up to you to fill in the blank!</li>\n<li>¿Dónde está mi hotel? – how to find your way to your hotel.</li>\n<li>¿Dónde hay un banco? – If you’re looking for a nearby bank.</li>\n<li>¿Dónde hay un cajero automático? – if you only need an ATM machine, you go for this question instead.</li>\n<li>¿Dónde hay un restaurante? – how to ask for a restaurant.</li>\n<li>¿Dónde hay un hospital? – how yo ask for a hospital.</li>\n<li>¿Dónde puedo encontrar…? – “Where can I find…?”</li>\n<li>¿Dónde puedo encontrar un taxi? – How to ask for a taxi.</li>\n<li>¿Dónde puedo encontrar a un policía? – the way to find a policeman.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Eating out</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Tengo una reservación. – “I have a reservation,”</li>\n<li>De tomar, quiero/quisiera… – “To drink, I would like…”</li>\n<li>De entrada, quiero/quisiera… – “For my appetizer, I would like…”</li>\n<li>Como plato principal, quiero/quisiera… – “As a main course, I would like…”</li>\n<li>Yo soy vegeterano- “I’m vegetarian”</li>\n<li>No como… – “I don’t eat…”</li>\n<li>¡Salud! – “cheers”</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Shopping</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>¿Puedo probarme…? – “can I try on....</li>\n<li>¿Hasta qué hora está? - “Until what time are you open?”</li>\n<li>¿Qué precio tiene…? – “What is the price?”</li>\n<li>¿Es el mejor precio que me da? - “Is that the best price you can do?”</li>\n<li>Puedo darle… – “I can give you,” to offer a price on an item.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Asking for help</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Necesito ayuda. – Short and to the point, this phrase simply means “I need help.”</li>\n<li>¿Usted habla inglés? – Use this phrase to ask if someone speaks English.</li>\n<li>¿Dónde puedo encontrar a alguien que hable inglés? – “Where can I find someone who speaks English?”</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Thank you and goodbye</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Gracias – You probably already knew how to say “thank you” in Spanish, but this is just a quick reminder that politeness is appreciated even more in Hispanic and Latino cultures. Say it, and say it a lot!</li>\n<li>Adiós – “goodbye.”</li>\n<li>Hasta luego – “see you later.”</li>\n<li>Hasta mañana – “See you tomorrow,”</li>\n<li>Nos vemos – “See you”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Have you ever had an interesting experience because of language barriers in Spain?
