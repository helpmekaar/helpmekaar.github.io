She appeared well before them and all the more frequently when I started\nleaving food out for her. Today, the four kittens, one male and three females, are now semi-domesticated due to our\ncare. The mother remains unapproachable but still turns up daily for food, along with her gang of other stray cats,\naround four of them - possibly her own kittens from previous litters.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>For some people they’re vulnerable animals in need of protection. For others of course, they’re pests that need to be\neradicated, or worse, ignored.</p>\n<p>Why don’t the Spanish neuter or spay their cats as a matter of obvious choice? When kittens are born, they are either\ndrowned or turned out. For the arguably unlucky survivors it’s a hard life and only the fittest, healthiest, most\ncunning, survive. But even these ones don’t seem to live very long.</p>\n<p>Most feral cats are born in the wild and never experience human companionship during their critical period of\nsocialization (about 2-9 weeks of age), so they will always remain frightened of people. Only very young feral kittens\ncan learn to adjust to living in a home. Feral cats left to fend for themselves isn't a great option. Untended street\ncats face death by starvation, disease, inclement weather, traffic and predatory animals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://images.expatty.com/blog/feral-cats.png\" alt=\"Feral cats infographic\"></p>\n<p>Experts estimate that 60 to 70 percent of wild-born kittens die in their first 6 months. Feral cats that do survive\nkitten-hood then spend the rest of their lives struggling to find food and repeatedly breeding... adding more homeless\nkittens to the growing population. Forming cat colonies is one of their survival tools.</p>\n<p>There are no simple solutions. Some people try to help feral cats by leaving dishes of food, but unfortunately, feeding\nalone of course does not solve any problems. Extra food usually brings more cats into the area...leading to fighting,\ninfectious disease transmission, and lots of homeless kittens.</p>\n<div class=\"card medium\">\n    <img class=\"card-img-top\" src=\"https://images.expatty.com/blog/griffin.jpg\" alt=\"Griffin, one of the stray kittens we have domesticated\">\n    <div class=\"card-body\">\n        <p class=\"card-text dark-colour\">Griffin, one of the stray kittens we have domesticated</p>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<br>\n<h2>What is the solution?</h2>\n<p>Some humane groups have begun to use another strategy for dealing with feral cats. This method involves capturing,\nneutering, and vaccinating feral cats and then returning them to their former territory where they rejoin their existing\ncat colonies. Caretakers provide food and shelters to protect the cats in the colony from wind and weather.</p>\n<p>Backers of this method say it can effectively control feral populations because the neutered cats no longer reproduce\nbut they still continue to defend their territory against incoming cats.</p>\n<p>There are a few charities in Andalusia that try to help these cats:</p>\n<ul class=\"list-group dark-colour\" style=\"margin-left: 0\">\n  <li class=\"list-group-item\">\n    <a href=\"http://www.ace-charity.org/en\"><h3>Animal Care España</h3></a>\n    <p>ACE stands for 'Animal Care Espana', Spanish Hounds In Need, in short SHIN.
