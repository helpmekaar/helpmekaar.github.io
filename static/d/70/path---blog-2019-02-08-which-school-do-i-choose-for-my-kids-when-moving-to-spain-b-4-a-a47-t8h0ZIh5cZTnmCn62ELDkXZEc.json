The\nyoungest was due to start secondary school and the oldest her first year of GCSE. We really wanted them to immerse\nthemselves into the Spanish culture and learn the language, but was a Spanish school the best option for them at this\npoint in their lives?</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>There were a number of considerations, from choosing a school to ensuring they would settle in to their new life in a\ndifferent country. Of course we would have preferred for our kids to go to a Spanish school, but we couldn’t help but\nworry about how on earth they would manage to communicate, adapt and fit in... especially at their ages. In the end, we\ndiscussed the options with the girls and we all decided that continuing their education in a British system would be the\neasiest and best for them.</p>\n<p>Before we came to the conclusion we had done a lot of research into our schooling options and decided to post it here\nto help anyone struggling to make the same decision we had to.</p>\n<p>The education system in Spain offers three options of schooling:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>State schools</li>\n<li>Private schools</li>\n<li>International schools</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Public schools are free of charge while <em>concertados</em> are private schools that receive government funding in exchange\nfor signing education agreements with the local authority.</p>\n<p>Education in Spain is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 16. In Spain school starts the calendar year your child turns 3.\nThey attend nursery classes until they are 6 and then transfer to the junior school. Junior classes cover similar\nsubjects as British schools, such as maths, science, history and geography. The school year is set annually but usually\nruns from the first week of September until the last week of June. The timetable at public schools is usually seven\nhours a day, Monday to Friday, but varies slightly depending on the school, the region and the age of the children.</p>\n<p>It is compulsory to learn Castilian at all schools, even where Spanish is not the main language. In regions with other\nlanguages, it is also compulsory to learn the co-official language – for example, Catalan in Catalonia. In addition,\nchildren must learn a foreign language, which in many cases is English.</p>\n<p>Children start secondary school at age 12 and study for a school certificate. They can then go on to college at 16 to\nstudy the Spanish Baccalaureate, which is comparable to A Levels in the UK.</p>\n<p>Assessment is continuous and based on exams, with lower-achieving children having to repeat a year. Spain has the\nhighest rate of repeat-year performances in Europe. If they pass, the student is awarded a Certificate of Compulsory\nSecondary Education.</p>\n<p>The advantages of sending your child to a Spanish school are that it is free, the school will likely be in your local\nvillage and will be easy to drive to and they would be able to immerse themselves into village life. However, If your\nchild is being educated in Spanish, you will need to keep English spelling and grammar up at home if you intend for them\nto return to the British education system at some stage.</p>\n<p>I will conclude by saying this about making the choice between Spanish or English schools: you don’t know if it’s the\nperfect choice, but your gut instinct will not lead you astray.</p>\n<p>For more information, visit our school listings <a href=\"https://expatty.com/categories/school/\">here</a>.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/blog/2019-02-08-which-school-do-i-choose-for-my-kids-when-moving-to-spain/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Which school do I choose for my kids when moving to Spain?","description":"Making the choice of schools when moving to Spain can be tricky.
